# Digital-Clock
This project is a real-time digital clock web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current **hour**, **minute**, and **second** in a visually appealing format, with an AM/PM indicator. The background can be customized to an image of choice, making the design more aesthetically pleasing.
